# The Black Rabbit
### A Signal. A Secret. A Test.

> *“Doors do not open to the worthy. They open to those who refuse to stop knocking.”*

## I. The Invocation

Somewhere on the edges of the digital wilderness, there is a single portal — cold, black, silent.  
It does not advertise itself. It does not explain.  
It asks only one question:

**Can you open it?**

Anyone may approach. Many will pass beyond its first threshold.  
But in the end, **only one will solve what lies at its core.**

## II. The Rite

Somewhere behind the noise and static, a gate stands. It does not open with force. It does not respond to chance.
It listens for intention — for the signal hidden inside noise.

Those who seek it must learn to speak its language.
They must knock in the way the door understands.
They must prove they wish to cross.

Most will pass it by, unaware.
Some will approach and turn away.
A few will continue forward.

You are free to attempt the portal as many times as you dare.  
Each attempt brings you closer — or further away — from the truth.

Only one will reach what lies beyond.

## III. The Revelation

What lies beyond the final lock is not stated here.  
It may be digital or physical. It may be symbolic or tangible.  
It may be worthless — or priceless.

What is certain is this:  
**Only one will claim it.**  
Only one will win.

## IV. The Covenant

1. **There is a code.**  
   Unknown. Unrevealed.  
   It may be guessed, discovered, deduced — but never given.

2. **There is a cost.**  
   Each attempt requires an offering — a mark of intent upon the threshold.  
   Those who value nothing solve nothing.

3. **There is no time limit.**  
   The portal will wait.  
   Whether it takes hours, days, or years — the end will come.

## V. The Invitation

The Black Rabbit does not seek followers, customers, or acclaim.
It exists for those who feel the pull of the unknown — those who sense that some doors must be opened simply because they are closed.

If you are reading this, you are already on the path.

> **Enter. Persist. Endure.**  
> **Only one will win.**
