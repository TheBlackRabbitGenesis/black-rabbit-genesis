# 🐇 The Black Rabbit — Genesis

> A signal has been sent. A threshold has been built.  
> Many may enter. Only one will win.

### I. The Beginning

This repository contains the **genesis record** of **The Black Rabbit** — a digital threshold, an unfolding enigma, and a proving ground that exists beyond entertainment, commerce, or explanation.

It is not a game.  
It is not an experiment.  
It is an **invitation**.

---

### II. The Invocation

Somewhere in the static, a door waits.  
It does not open to the impatient.  
It does not yield to chance.

It listens.  
It watches.  
It responds only to intention.

Each who approaches leaves a trace — a signal on the network — and in doing so becomes part of a story larger than themselves.

### III. The Path

The Black Rabbit is composed of three elements:

1. **The Portal**   
2. **The Offering**  
3. **The Code**

Many will step forward.  
Most will fail.  
A few will persist.

Only one will pass beyond the final lock.

### IV. The Unknown

What lies beyond is not described here.    
Its nature matters less than the act itself — the refusal to turn away.

This is the essence of The Black Rabbit.  
To endure is to participate.  
To continue is to become part of its myth.

---

### V. The Invitation

The Black Rabbit does not ask for followers.  
It does not seek recognition.  
It exists for those who *must know*.

If you understand the nature of the unknown — if you feel the pull to step forward — the portal awaits.

> **Enter. Persist. Endure.**  
> **Only one will win.**
