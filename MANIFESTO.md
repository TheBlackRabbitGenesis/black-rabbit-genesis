# The Black Rabbit
### A Signal. A Secret. A Test.

> *“Doors do not open to the worthy. They open to those who refuse to stop knocking.”*

## I. The Premise

Somewhere on the edges of the digital wilderness, there is a single portal — cold, black, silent.  
It does not advertise itself. It does not explain.  
It asks only one question:

**Can you open it?**

Anyone may approach. Many will pass beyond its first threshold.  
But in the end, **only one will solve what lies at its core.**

## II. The Game

The Black Rabbit is not a product. It is not a company, a brand, or a startup.  
It is a *ritual* — a growing cryptographic puzzle that lives entirely online.

It hides in plain sight.  
It offers no instructions beyond a blinking cursor and a line of text.  
It rewards nothing but persistence, intelligence, and luck.

You are free to attempt the portal as many times as you dare.  
Each attempt brings you closer — or further away — from the truth.

There is no leaderboard.  
There is no public record.  
There is only the gate… and the one who will ultimately triumph.

## III. The Prize

What lies beyond the final lock is not stated here.  
It may be digital or physical. It may be symbolic or tangible.  
It may be worthless — or priceless.

What is certain is this:  
**Only one player will claim it.**  
Only one will win.

## IV. The Rules

1. **There is a code.**  
   Unknown. Unrevealed.  
   It may be guessed, discovered, deduced — but never given.

2. **There is a cost.**  
   Each attempt demands a token. A small offering to prove intent.  
   Those who value nothing solve nothing.

3. **There is no time limit.**  
   The portal will wait.  
   Whether it takes hours, days, or years — the end will come.

## V. The Invitation

The Black Rabbit is not seeking followers, customers, or fans.  
It seeks **seekers** — those drawn to riddles, obsessions, and the edges of the unknown.

If you are one of them, you are already late.  
The portal is live.

> **Enter. Persist. Endure.**  
> **Only one will win.**
